Senior Backend Engineer with a diverse background spanning from Philosophy to Ontology Engineering in Academia, and experience in Application Support and Software Development. My experience spans across various industries such as Academia, Consultancy, Telecoms, E-commerce, Big Data, Transport, Financial Services, and Automotive. 

With 8 + years of experience (in the UK, Germany and currently in Italy), I have a solid track record of working effectively with international, cross-functional, and geographically distributed teams.

My core Tech Stack is rooted in Golang, Grpc, Protobuf, JVM languages (Java and Kotlin), Spring and SpringBoot, Restful APIs Design & Development, Microservices, Event-Driven and Distributed Systems and more recently Ruby and Ruby on Rails. As a lifelong learner, I am a passionate Backend Engineer keen on constantly keeping up-to-date with new technologies and market's trends. 

I like to make "things happen" and I rarely capitulate. Before tackling any dev work, I need to have a 360 degrees view (aka Big Picture) and I really like to be part of the requirement gathering phase as well as the planning one. 

In my free time I enjoy reading, listening to music (I have a soft spot for Opera and Classical Music) and running/ fitness in general. I am also an avid gamer and a Sci-fi aficionado.
